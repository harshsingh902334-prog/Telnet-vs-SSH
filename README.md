# Telnet vs SSH Network Traffic Capture

This project demonstrates the security differences between Telnet and SSH.

## Project Overview
- Telnet traffic was captured and analysed using Wireshark.
- Usernames, passwords, and commands were visible in plaintext.
- SSH traffic was captured and analysed for comparison.
- SSH traffic appeared encrypted and unreadable.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- macOS
- Wireshark
- Telnet
- SSH

## Conclusion
Telnet is insecure because it transmits data in plaintext, while SSH encrypts all communication and is the industry-standard secure remote access protocol.
